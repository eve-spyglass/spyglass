The jumpbridge file can be accessed either from the internet by specifying a URL;
or by pointing to a local file

How to format the data for the jumpbridges:

Put all the jumpbridges in one single textfile, where a line in the file
represents a jumpbridge.

The line contains the first system, the connection between the systems and
the second system. Between the three parts there has to be a space.

The connection is a line (minus) in the middle and possible arrows (sign for
greater or lower) at the ends. If there is such a sign, an arrow will be
drawn on the map.
If selected, all jumpbridges will be drawn on map as bezier lines in different shades fo green.

Examples:

System1 <-> System2
System1 Â» System1

The first line will draw a jumpbridge between System1 and System2 with an
arrow on both sides, the second line is an example which may be copied directly from inside the eve client.

Write the system names exactly as they are written in the maps.
Don't forget the space in between the system names and the jumpbridge!
